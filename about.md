Hi there! I am **Victor Glazer**, a father of three living in New York City.

I drink far [too much coffee](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bf04054e74940effe961412/1542474890190-I1B1IY3UTJN08GJS6XYJ/tm1+cov.jpg?format=2500w), take care of two French Bulldogs and can generally be found at [FIELD + SUPPLY](https://fieldandsupply.com/pages/f-s-mrkts) twice a year. 

I briefly contemplated dropping out of undergrad to pursue a career as a Drum & Bass producer, though not before working on some [research projects](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA), hand-coding [this video](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer/gundam.avi) and making [this compiler](https://github.com/vglazer/csc488). 

Later on, I cut my [doctoral studies in Cryptography](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer/doc/VictorGlazerMSThesis.pdf) short to join a [Computer Vision startup](https://tineye.com/about).
