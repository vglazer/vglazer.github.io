Hi there! I am **Victor Glazer**.

I thought about dropping out of undergrad to pursue a career as a Drum & Bass producer, though not before working on some [research projects](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA) for [Rudi Mathon](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/people-faculty-combin.html) and [Christina Christara](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ccc/), creating this award-winning [animation](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~karan/monkey/winter2003/leeGlazer/gumdam.avi) with my friend [Min Lee](https://www.prepanywhere.com/about) and making a [compiler](https://github.com/vglazer/csc488) for a made-up programming language with [Jon Pipitone](https://jon.pipitone.ca/) and the rest of my CSC488 team.

After studying [Cryptography](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer/doc/VictorGlazerMSThesis.pdf) under [Charlie Rackoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rackoff) in grad school, I left without a PhD to join a Computer Vision startup called [TinEye](https://tineye.com/about), where I spent the next couple of years working on early Visual Search algorithms.

I then moved to New York City to help build the financial models that power [Aladdin](https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin), [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us)'s industry-leading investment management technology platform.
