Hi there! I am **Victor Glazer**.

After studying [Cryptography](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer/doc/VictorGlazerMSThesis.pdf) under [Charlie Rackoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rackoff) in grad school, I left without a PhD to join a Computer Vision startup called [TinEye](https://tineye.com/about), where I spent the next couple of years developing early Visual Search algorithms.

I then moved to New York City to help build the financial models that power [Aladdin](https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin), [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us)'s industry-leading investment management technology platform. I am now a Quant Developer at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/go/join-fidelity-investments).

Back in undergrad, I worked on [research projects](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA) for [Rudi Mathon](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/dcs/people-faculty-combin.html) and [Christina Christara](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ccc/), created an award-winning [animation](https://www.teach.cs.toronto.edu/~karan/monkey/winter2003/leeGlazer/gumdam.avi) with my friend [Min Lee](https://www.prepanywhere.com/about), and wrote a [compiler](https://github.com/vglazer/csc488) for a made-up language with [Jon Pipitone](https://jon.pipitone.ca/) and the rest of our CSC488 team.
