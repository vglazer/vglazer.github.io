Hi there! I am **Victor Glazer**.

I briefly contemplated dropping out of undergrad to pursue a career as a Drum & Bass producer, though not before working on some [research projects](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA), hand-coding [this animation](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer/gundam.avi) and making [this compiler](https://github.com/vglazer/csc488).

Later on, I cut my [doctoral studies in Cryptography](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer/doc/VictorGlazerMSThesis.pdf) short to join a [Computer Vision startup](https://tineye.com/about).

After that, I moved to New York City and spent the next 18 years working in Quantitative Finance at [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/about-us) as part of the [Aladdin](https://www.blackrock.com/aladdin) platform.
