Hi there! I am **Victor Glazer**, a father of three living in New York City.

I drink too much coffee and once contemplated dropping out of undergrad to pursue a career as a Drum & Bass producer. I ultimately decided against it, but later on I did end up cutting my doctoral studies in Cryptography short to join a Computer Vision startup.

For other fun facts about me, check out my [homepage](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~glazer).
